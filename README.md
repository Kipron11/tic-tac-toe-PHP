## Tic-Tac-Toe
Game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.

 To run App you need to clone the repository and write in linux terminal

``php tic-tac-toe.php`` assuming that you already installed PHP on your machine
